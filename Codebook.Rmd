ein: Employer identification number.  

object_id: Not unique for all observations. Seems to denote a “batch” of uploads from the IRS to Amazon Web Services. 

Observations were matched by combining ein and object_id, there might be some duplicates. 


fiscal_year: The year for which Form 990 was submitted. Based on RtrnHdr_TxPrdEndDt. 

FileTs: The time (24 hour format) at which the form was submitted. We use this variable to restrict our sample to the most recent submission. Based on RtrnHdr_RtrnTs.
