## How was the data cleaned?
* Cases where for Foreign Expenses, Foreign Services or Total Expenses were negative (lower than zero) were dropped from the sample.
* Cases where Total Expenses were missing (NA) were dropped from the sample.
* Cases where Foreign Expenses, Total Expenses, or Foreign Services were missing (NA), they were converted to zero (0).
* Cases where the Proportion of Foreign Expenses relative to the Total Expenses was larger than 1.02 (102%) were dropped from the sample.
* In cases of duplicated filings, only the most recent tax filing was kept. The slice_max function was used.
* Dollar amounts were converted into 100,000 USD.
* Dollar amounts were converted into constant or real 2013 dollars based on the deflation method used by the BLS.
