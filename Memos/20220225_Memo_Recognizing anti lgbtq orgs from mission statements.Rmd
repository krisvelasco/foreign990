The procedure I propose in this memo is based on Robert Nielsen's *Deadly Clerics*. He describes his method in chapter 5: *Recognizing Jihadists from Their Writings.*

**Goal**
We want to distinguish anti-LGBTQ+ organizations out of all non-profit organizations that submit a 990 Form. We will be using their mission statements as a way of recognizing them.

**Steps**

1. Define anti-LGBTQ+ ideology.

+ We need a canonical source of anti-LGBTQ+ ideology. Nielsen uses *The Jihadist's Bookbag*. We need a similar corpus of documents that potentially "showcase" anti-LGBTQ+ ideology. **Something that anti-LGBTQ+ orgs have done themselves?**
+ We also need another similar corpus for verification.
+ We also need a canonical source of non anti-LGBTQ+ ideology. **Would these be pro-LGBTQ+ or just a general sample of "neutral" organizations?**

2. Use these two corpora to train a model. A naive Bayes classifier (or something better, but that's what Nielsen uses) will produce an **anti-LGBTQ+ score**. This essentially alludes to the likelihood that a word *would* be in an anti-LBTQ+ text or not.

3. Run the model on the mission statements.

4. Verify.
+ To verify, we are going to need some materials:
+ the Democracy Now and SLP lists could work to check for miss-classifications.

**Things to consider**

+ Communication in mission statements is strategically deceitful. That is, **if non-profits have an incentive to escape recognition through their mission statements, then it is likely that they do not use a lot of discriminating words.**

+ If there is little use of discriminating words, the bag of words approach won't work.

+ What are our points of comparison: anti vs pro? anti vs non-anti?
